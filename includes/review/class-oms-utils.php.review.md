Review:

*   Maintainability:  Mostly good. Functions are relatively short and focused.  `is_path_safe` has a long list of suspicious characters which could be extracted to a constant for better readability and easier modification.
*   Adherence to Patterns/Best Practices:  Uses static methods appropriately for utility functions.  `sanitize_url` uses `filter_var` which is good practice.  `is_path_safe` could benefit from a more robust approach to path validation.

Areas for Improvement:

*   `is_path_safe` (line 31-52): The list of suspicious characters is hardcoded and could be moved to a constant. The check is also basic and might not catch all edge cases.
*   `is_path_safe` (line 31):  Checking against `ABSPATH` might be too restrictive. Consider allowing paths within a specific upload directory or a configurable set of allowed paths.
*   `sanitize_url` (line 63): The manual removal of dangerous characters before `filter_var` is redundant as `filter_var` with `FILTER_SANITIZE_URL` already handles most of these cases.

Suggested Changes:

*   `is_path_safe`: Extract the suspicious character array to a constant. Consider using a more robust path validation library or a more comprehensive check. Allow for configurable allowed paths.
*   `sanitize_url`: Remove the manual character replacement and rely solely on `filter_var`.

Score: 7/12 (Mid-level developer). The code is functional and mostly follows best practices but has some areas for improvement in terms of robustness and maintainability.
