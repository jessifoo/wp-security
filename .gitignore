# WordPress Core Files (should never be bundled with plugins)
# CRITICAL: Bundling WordPress core files (especially admin-ajax.php) causes AJAX requests
# to hit the plugin's private wp-load.php instead of the host site's core, leading to fatals.
# WordPress core is downloaded dynamically via:
# - setup-wordpress.sh (uses wp core download)
# - GitHub Actions workflows (WordPress/plugin-check-action handles WordPress installation)
# - Never commit WordPress core files to this repository
